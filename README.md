# Overlapper
Dynamic and high-fidelity implementation of the Add Overlap tool.

This was based on the Add Overlap extension by Alexandre Saumier Demers.
**Warning:** Makes off-curve start points into on-curves in the process.



#### Next steps:
- Make it into some sort of extension in which the user can set the hotkey.
- Speed it up somehow...

#### Thank you for the advice:
- Frank Griesshammer
- Jackson Cavanaugh
- Andy Clymer
